    #   To comply with these terms:

    #   P.S.:  An MIT license is much easier to comply with than a "Attribute-ShareAlike" license,
    #          which is why we use the MIT license for the Gem project for all our own original code.
    #
    #          Of course the MIT license, does *NOT* apply to the orignal of the code, which has its
    #          own license as indicated above.
    #
    #          To make things simple, all *changes* to the original code below are dual licensed under
    #          both (1) the MIT License that the rest of Gem is licensed; and (2) under the exact same
    #          "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported" license as the original code.
    #
    #   NOTE:  Dual copyright only applies to the changes, not to the original code which is obviously
    #          only licensed under the original license.
