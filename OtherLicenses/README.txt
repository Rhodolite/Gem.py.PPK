The Gem project (including the PPK-py sub-project) uses the MIT license for all original code.

For code copied from other projects:

     The copyright & code is enclosed in:

         #
         #<copyright>
         #
         #      Copyright ...
         #
         def external_code()
            pass
         #</copyright>

    Any changes to the copyright code are between the <copyright> and </copyright> tags, and
    [for simplicity] are dual licensed by both the MIT license & the same license as the external
    code.

    NOTE:  Dual license only applies to the changes, not to the original code which is obviously
           only licensed under the original license.


===================================================================================================


For licenses copied from other projects:

         This file lists their copyrights.

Since this file is listing other copyrights & license, these copyrights & license are themselves
copyrighted & licensed.  It thus, self referentially, also uses:

         #
         #<copyright>
         #
         #      Copyright ...
         #
         ...
         #</copyright>

around any copyrights or licenses.

    #
    #   P.S.:  An MIT license is much easier to comply with than a "Attribute-ShareAlike" license,
    #          which is why we use the MIT license for the Gem project for all our own original code
    #          and text.
    #
    #          Of course the MIT license, does *NOT* apply to the original of the text, which has its
    #          own license as indicated above.
    #
    #          To make things simple, all *changes* to the original text below are dual licensed under
    #          both (1) the MIT License that the rest of Gem is licensed; and (2) under the exact same
    #          "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license."
    #
    #   NOTE:  Dual copyright only applies to the changes, not to the original code which is obviously
    #          only licensed under the original license.
